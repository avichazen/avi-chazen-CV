# About
Thanks for visiting! I am a service professional with broad experience in the travel industry, looking for my next challenge as a Technical Writer.

Don't you just hate a poorly written manual with bad English?? Ughh!
When I want to know how to use my dishwasher, I don't want to feel like I'm marking a 4th grader's homework!
I'm on a mission to make easy-to-use, clear, and concise documentation that is a pleasure to use when needed, including:
* User Guides
* Manuals
* QuickStarts
* Restaurant Menus
* Work Procedures
* Instructional Material
